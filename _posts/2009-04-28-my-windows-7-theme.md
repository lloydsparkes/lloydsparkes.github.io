Well I&#8217;m now on Windows 7 RC, and I&#8217;m going to stay with the RC until RTM (i cant keep reinstalling everytime there&#8217;s a leak!!!!)

Anyway I&#8217;m not a fan of the bundled theme so i have made my own, which although simple is quite nice.

Its a lovely picture of Jennifer Aniston (Suitable for Work), with the Window Colour set to Frost.

Here it is to [download](http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/files/lloydsparkes-theme.themepack), and the preview is below.
