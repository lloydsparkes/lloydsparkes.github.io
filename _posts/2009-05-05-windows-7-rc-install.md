Yesterday after i got the Official Windows 7 RC from MSDNAA i decided to do a complete reinstall. Due to the improvements in Windows 7 i managed to get my system to the same state it was a little under 4 hours previously. Which is amazingly fast. The slowest thing to install was Visual Studio 2008 Sp1 taking around 30 minutes, but everything else installed in 10 minutes, with Windows taking a little under 20 minutes.

And i have yet to find anything problems. Good Work Microsoft
