Windows 7 is finished, and its very good, and very polished, and it introduces a lot of new very good features but you can always add more, and can always improve so here&#8217;s my wish list for Windows 8.

  * User mode file system interface.
  * More emphasis on .Net and WPF. It should be used in all the utility applications in Windows, (Paint, Notepad, WordPad, Calculator).
  * Aero Snap to corners. So 4 windows on the screen, one in each corner.
  * Make MSI(Large Installations) and Click Once(Small Utility Installations with auto update) the default and only way to install Software. This helps provide a more consistent setup interface, and should also get rid of the problem of faulty installers.
  * Release a Free “Visual Studio” Edition for creating MSI and Click Once installers to make the above point easier for developers to achieve, (especially for those who are not already using Visual Studio for Development).
  * Built in PDF/PS reader.
  * SVG Support.
  * Update WMP Interface, take tips from Zune Player
  * Add Extensions to .Net to cover Windows Specific Elements like Jump lists and etc(This could happen with .Net 4.0). This make it easier than having to use Windows7Integration and Vista Bridge Interop Code.

Chances are i will follow this post up but for now its all i can think off. It was really hard work to come up with this list… Windows 7 is just that good.
