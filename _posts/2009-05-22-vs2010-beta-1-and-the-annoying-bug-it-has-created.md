I have had VS2010 Beta 1 since Tuesday, and its brilliant, it seriously good, and i have been working on my twitter client in it. 

But all this good has been destroyed by one little annoying bug ([my Microsoft Connect bug report](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=455355)). 

Basically when i access a menu item in any of the following applications (List Growing) Live Writer, Explorer, IE8, Live Mesh. The Menu Item will not disappear, but it will persist. Now here&#8217;s the weird bit, to clean the menu item i just need to close Media Center or Media Player. 

Its very weird and very annoying when its in the middle of the screen. 

I know its beta and i should expect bugs but MS please patch this ASAP!!!
