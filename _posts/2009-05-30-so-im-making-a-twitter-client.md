Over the last few weeks i have been learning WPF, and have been creating a Twitter Client

While i am still learning, this is what i have produced so far, although now i have learnt more i am planning on a slight redesign

<div class="mceTemp">
  [edit: there was a picture here, but due to a server crash it disappeared (i now have better backups)]
</div>

What do you think?

I did have to stop using Visual Studio 2010 as its editor was playing up and begin really slow, although this is a beta, and i expect this to be corrected
