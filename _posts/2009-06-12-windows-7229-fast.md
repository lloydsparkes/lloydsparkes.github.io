I installed Windows 7 7229 today on my netbook, its fast, i mean very fast for my netbook(1.2ghz, Hp 2133). 

1. The installer was a lot faster, no waiting for it to load(this used to take 10minutes alone now <1minute).

2. <40 second boot.

3. 10 second shutdown

4. 5GB HDD space used (not including page file / hibernation disabled). 

This build also gets a working Graphics driver off Windows Update, that allows Sleep, Aero, and Windows Performance tools to work (previous drivers blocked Sleep mode)
