A few weeks ago one of my misguided friends showed me his favourite twitter client – tweetie, and it has a very good UI layout idea. Rather than having a selection of tabs or filters across the top, it has them down the side. This solves the problem i was trying to solve in the UI of custom created tabs and filters. 

So the initial problem was that i wanted a single column of tweets, and from my experience of twitter clients i automatically had the tabs on the top of the column of tweets, this lead to only having 4 tabs before i ran out of space. Anyway i saw tweetie and saw how it did it down the left side and this would solve my problem so i have taken a shot at implementing it.

In this design i have also customized and added extra features, a optional Close button so the tab can be closed, and a number which represents the the number of new tweets in that tab.

[<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="RedKite" border="0" alt="RedKite" src="http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/RedKite_thumb.png" width="394" height="603" />](http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/RedKite.png) I am still working on making the code and templates for this properly, so it can be themed with minimal effort, if you want to take a look at the code, head over to [my project on CodePlex](http://redkite.codeplex.com/) and tell me what you think.

I’m about to start working on the Art for the splash screen and icons, so they should be up here soon.
