Its been a white since I&#8217;ve blogged due to various reasons. Most of these reasons are due to various hosting providers misbehaving.

I have still been doing other things.

RedKite v 0.1 was released and although it still needs some UI adjustments, but v 0.2 is well on its way.

<img style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" title="RedKite v0.1" src="http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/RedKitev0.1.png" alt="RedKite v 0.1" width="406" height="817" />

I got my phone upgraded to a HTC Hero, which is a truly awesome device, even though i do miss Windows Mobile, Android is actually pretty good, although it does suffer from some rather lame parts of Google Apps, like Calendar which is just absolutely crap.

Windows 7 has been released to manufacturing, and i have been running it on my machines since it was given to MSDN, its brilliant and faster than ever.

I&#8217;m currently working on a post about what i would like to see in Windows 8, which should be coming up soon.
