I was recently using [this theme](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-set-a-bing-wallpaper-desktop-slideshow-in-windows-7/) which is based on a RSS of the images used on [Bing](http://bing.com/) worldwide.

And i was looking at one particular image of Dartmoor (Devon, UK) and thought it fitted in nicely. So here it is all packaged up for you to use.

Note i am using [Fences](http://www.stardock.com/products/fences/) which provides the boxes on the right of my screen, its really rather cool and i know it copies a feature from KDE4, but its rather useful.
