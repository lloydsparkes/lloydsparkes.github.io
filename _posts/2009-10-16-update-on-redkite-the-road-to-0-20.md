I have been working on RedKite for the past few days and am making some headway towards version 0.2

Here&#8217;s the latest Screenshot of it

[<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="RedKite-0.2.r5" border="0" alt="RedKite-0.2.r5" src="http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/RedKite0.2.r5_thumb.png" width="390" height="775" />](http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/RedKite0.2.r5.png)

It still desires a fair amount of work in the UI department, but i have decided to concentrate on functionality until i can find a good design for the UI, or someone creates a good design.

All feedback is welcome.
