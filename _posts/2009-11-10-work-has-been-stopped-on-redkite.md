Today i decided to stop work on RedKite, for a few reasons:

  1. I found a client called [sobees](http://www.sobees.com/download) which does pretty much everything i wanted out of RedKite
  2. I have plenty of other projects i am working on
  3. RedKite requires a lot more work to get it to the Quality of sobees.

I am slightly saddened by this, but now i can spend time on my next major project, which is a decent IRC Client for Windows.
