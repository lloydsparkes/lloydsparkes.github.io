This is part two in my progress report on the game I&#8217;m writing for Windows Phone 7. This week i have made a lot of background changes. I have now added Buttons, Taps (from touch panels on Windows Phone 7, and Clicks on Windows). I have added a Load Game screen. You can now also traverse all of the menus.

Next week i intend to work on the graphics (because it is very ugly at the moment) and the code which draws the landscape to make it efficient as possible. I also have some plans to add support for none rectangular buttons.

Anyway these are the screenshots so farâ€¦
