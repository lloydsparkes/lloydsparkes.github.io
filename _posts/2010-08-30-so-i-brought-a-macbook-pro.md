As my old laptop is rather crap (battery, speed, graphics) and it was restricting me from getting any real work done I decided to move up my intended purchase of a new laptop mainly a MacBook Pro 13.3/2.4/4/250.

Now I am a Microsoft fan and i generally hate Apple so why did I buy a MacBook Pro?

  * Student Discount – only £860
  * Lovely Screen with a good pixel density (1280&#215;800 on 13.3” which is same resolution as my old laptop which is 1280&#215;800 on 15”)
  * Exceptional Battery Life
  * Pretty damn good quality of hardware and design (although the Apple logo on the back annoys me)
  * Runs OS X without messing about so I can use OS X as a test/dev environment.
  * They are well known for running Windows exceptionally well.

Ok so that&#8217;s why I brought it, but how did it go? It didn&#8217;t go so well. In the space of 7 days I have had to have my MBP replaced twice due to dead pixels on the first two. The nearest Apple store is in Bristol which is a good 5-6hour round trip and I have now made that journey 3 times which as you can imagine is quite annoying. Anyway i finally got a non faulty MBP and it is now setup with all my favourite software, but there were some issues with this.

First issue is that you cannot boot a Windows installer from USB using the default EFI firmware, to get around this you need to install [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net/) which does allow it.

The second issue was turning off the annoying Start-up boing to turn that off you need to get [StartupSound.prefpane](http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~arcana/StartupSound/index.en.html).

At the moment I am on a terrible internet connection (only getting 40KB/s) and OS X wanted over 1gb of updates (including X-Code update) which it will download in the background if you don&#8217;t turn it off. To turn it off go to Apple Logo –> System Preferences –> Software Updates and turn off automatic downloading.

The most recent issue i have had is in Windows and finding the hash-key (which doesn&#8217;t work in Live Writer for some weird reason). After about 15minutes of playing around and downloading the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8be579aa-780d-4253-9e0a-e17e51db2223&DisplayLang=en) i found out it is Alt-GR (the Alt on the right hand side of the keyboard) + 3

Anyway I&#8217;m really pleased with it, and it runs Windows 7 like a dream, its almost as powerful as my desktop. With some initial testing Windows does get a good 7+ hours out of the battery which while begin 3 less than OS X, its still very good.
