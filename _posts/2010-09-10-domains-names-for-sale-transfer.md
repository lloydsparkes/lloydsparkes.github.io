So i brought a new domain name today and I&#8217;ve realised how much I&#8217;m spending on domains each year so i have decided to sell / get rid of some of them.</p> 

If you are interested in any of the following please post a comment and we can arrange a transfer of ownership if an offer isn&#8217;t made on a domain by the lay day in october i will simply unregister it, and it will fall back to my registrar who will probably charge a lot more for you to acquire it.

Anyway the domain names are:

  * <s>microsoftbugtracker.com</s>
  * <s>windowsbugtracker.com</s>
  * <s>stayoffthecake.com</s>
  * applesucks.co.uk

If your interested post me a comment (with your email address so i can reply) or email me if you have my email address.
