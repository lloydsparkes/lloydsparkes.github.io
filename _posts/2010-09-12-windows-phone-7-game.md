So i am still making slow progress on my game, but in terms of functionality its almost finished. Here is an updated shot of the game.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="GamePlay4" src="http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/WindowsPhone7Game_73BC/GamePlay4_thumb.png" border="0" alt="GamePlay4" width="545" height="290" />](http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/WindowsPhone7Game_73BC/GamePlay4.png)

As you can see it it now fits the screen properly, on the last blog post i had forgotten to set the full screen property in the Game initialisation code. The quality of the graphics is still really lacking, but that will be solved soon.
