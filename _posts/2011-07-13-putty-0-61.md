Yesterday Putty 0.61 was released. I have updated my [Putty x64 build page](http://blog.lloydsparkes.co.uk/putty-x64/) with the latest installer (MSI) and binaries.

The installer \*should\* upgrade from the previous release version without issues, it might just install over the SVN version if you have that installed, so it might be worth removing the SVN version before upgrading.

Enjoy.
